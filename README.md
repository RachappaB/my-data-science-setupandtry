# My Data Science Environment Setup

This project is aimed at setting up a reproducible and efficient data science environment using Docker. The environment will have all the necessary Python libraries pre-installed to run various data science and machine learning tasks, and it will also allow you to run Jupyter notebooks with ease. Every time the Docker container runs, your local Git repository will be mounted, so any code or data you work with inside Jupyter will be saved directly into your repository.

## Project Goals

- **Containerized Data Science Setup**: Using Docker to ensure a consistent environment with all necessary libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, and more.
- **Local Development**: Mount a local Git directory so that all your work is saved directly to your local system, making version control easy.
- **Efficient Workflow**: Launch a Jupyter Notebook server in the Docker container, accessible through your browser, to run and experiment with your data science projects.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed on your system. If not, the script will help with the installation.

## Installation and Usage

### Step 1: Make the Installation Script Executable

First, you need to make the installation script (`install_and_run_docker.sh`) executable. This script will install Docker, pull the appropriate Docker image, and set up the environment for you.

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
chmod +x install_and_run_docker.sh
./install_and_run_docker.sh
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Work Directory

After the Docker container is running, you can access Jupyter Notebook in your browser. All the code and data you work on inside the notebook will be saved in your local Git repository under the `work` directory.

This directory is mounted from your local machine's path:

```bash
/home/rachappa/Downloads/github/my-data-science-setupandtry
```

All files you create, modify, or delete within Jupyter will be reflected in this local directory, which allows for seamless version control using Git.

### Step 3: Access the Jupyter Notebook

Once the Docker container is running, open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8888
```

You will be able to access the Jupyter Notebook interface where you can write and run your Python code. All code you run will be saved in the `work` directory, so you donâ€™t lose any progress.

### Step 4: Committing Your Work

Since your Jupyter notebooks are saved directly in your Git repository, you can commit your changes just like any other file:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new data science code and notebooks"
git push
```

This ensures your work is version-controlled and can be shared with collaborators or stored remotely.

### Libraries Installed in the Docker Container

The following essential Python libraries are pre-installed in the Docker container:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Keras
- SciKit-Learn
- PyTorch
- Scrapy
- BeautifulSoup
- LightGBM
- ELI5
- Theano
- NuPIC
- Ramp
- Pipenv
- Bob
- PyBrain
- Caffe2
- Chainer

These libraries cover a wide range of tasks from machine learning and deep learning to data scraping and visualization.

### Notes

- Make sure Docker is running before you execute the script.
- If there are any issues with the setup or installation, refer to the Docker documentation or troubleshoot based on the error messages you receive.
